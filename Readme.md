# C++ OOP Concepts with Examples

This repository contains C++ programs demonstrating the four main Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts: **Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction**.

##  Concepts Covered

1. **Encapsulation** - Restricting direct access to data and providing controlled access via methods.
2. **Inheritance** - Reusing code by deriving new classes from existing ones.
3. **Polymorphism** - Methods that behave differently based on the object.
4. **Abstraction** - Hiding implementation details and providing only necessary functionalities.

## Code Examples

###  Encapsulation
Encapsulation ensures that data is hidden and only accessible through public methods.

- Example 1: Basic Encapsulation
- Example 2: Getter and Setter Methods

###  Inheritance
Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class.

- Example 1: Single Inheritance
- Example 2: Multiple Inheritance

###  Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows different classes to have methods with the same name but different behavior.

- Example 1: Function Overloading
- Example 2: Function Overriding

###  Abstraction
Abstraction provides an interface without exposing implementation details.

- Example 1: Abstract Class with Pure Virtual Function
- Example 2: Interface Implementation

### 5️⃣ Encapsulation & Inheritance Combined
A program demonstrating both encapsulation and inheritance.

##  How to Run the Code

1. **Install a C++ compiler** (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC).
2. **Compile the code** using the command:
   ```sh
   g++ program_name.cpp -o output
   ```
3. **Run the executable**:
   ```sh
   ./output
   ```
